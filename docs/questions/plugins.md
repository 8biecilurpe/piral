# Plugins

## Do you support Angular (2+)?

Short answer - yes.

Piral is primarily using React, which makes it necessary for you to build your Piral instance in React. As such you should try to communicate that pilets should be build in React, too. However, we know that there are many different applications out there and reuse is desired. Therefore, we created `piral-ng`, which is an plugin package that you can integrate into your Piral instance. As a result pilets can use any existing Angular components efficiently.

For documentation on `piral-ng` please consult the [package information](https://npmjs.com/package/piral-ng).

## Do you support Angular.js (1.x)?

Short answer - yes.

Piral is primarily using React, which makes it necessary for you to build your Piral instance in React. As such you should try to communicate that pilets should be build in React, too. However, we know that there are many different applications out there and reuse is desired. Therefore, we created `piral-ngjs`, which is an plugin package that you can integrate into your Piral instance. As a result pilets can use any existing Angular.js components efficiently.

For documentation on `piral-ngjs` please consult the [package information](https://npmjs.com/package/piral-ngjs).

## Do you support Inferno?

Short answer - yes.

Piral is primarily using React, which makes it necessary for you to build your Piral instance in React. As such you should try to communicate that pilets should be build in React, too. However, we know that there are many different applications out there and reuse is desired. Therefore, we created `piral-inferno`, which is an plugin package that you can integrate into your Piral instance. As a result pilets can use any existing Inferno components efficiently.

For documentation on `piral-inferno` please consult the [package information](https://npmjs.com/package/piral-inferno).

**Remark**: We would recommend, however, aliasing `inferno` with `react` since they are mostly API compatible anyway. Reworking the few pieces that are incompatible should be worth the effort.

## Do you support web components?

Short answer - yes.

Since web components are just HTML elements you can already use the standard HTML render mode, as well as the possibility of rendering extensions as HTML elements.

For an improved experience we recommend using web components together with LitElement. Here, our `piral-litel` plugin could be helpful.

## Do you support Mithril.js?
