# Extensions

## Do you support Angular?

Short answer - yes.

Piral is primarily using React, which makes it necessary for you to build your Piral instance in React. As such you should try to communicate that pilets should be build in React, too. However, we know that there are many different applications out there and reuse is desired. Therefore, we created `piral-ng`, which is an extension package that you can integrate into your Piral instance. As a result pilets can use any existing Angular components efficiently.

For documentation on `piral-ng` please consult the [package information](https://npmjs.com/package/piral-ng).
