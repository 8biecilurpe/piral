# History

In the past we developed several "grand scale web apps", which have been deployed not only on the web, but also packaged as apps.

The requirements and essential feature set of these apps was always the same (as viewed from a high-level perspective):

- React as core layer
- Extensibility from the ground up
- Rich common API for these extensions
- Support for multiple languages
- Enhanced developer experience

This kind of "grand scale web app" is labeled by us as a "portal application". The reason is simple: The individual extension modules, which we call "pilets" are nothing more than a window to see / interact with part of the backend. Like a portal Piral itself just connects all these different modules.

After developing (or refining) the same solution over and over again the need for a generic (FOSS) solution became obvious. With Piral we want to reach that goal to provide a layer that boosts development of such applications. Our goal is to reduce the development need to only require setting up the domain specific parts and needed customizations (e.g., having a custom design, wording, ...).

In a nutshell Piral tries to allow you to

> easily build a next generation portal application.

We want to provide the full end-to-end experience, from development to releasing in production.

In December 2018 we began planning the project. In February 2019 the first code was written. The first real applications using Piral are expected to be released in the second half of 2019. Currently, the first production-ready version is anticipated for H1 2020.
