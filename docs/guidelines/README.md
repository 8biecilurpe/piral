# Guidelines

Diving into microfrontends using a comprehensive solution such as Piral may be overwhelming. In order to make using Piral as simple as possible we created a collection of guides that should allow you to only obtain the pieces of information that are relevant for your use case.

We divide this collection into two areas; recipes for setting up a Piral instance (only relevant for people creating the microfrontend shell application, i.e., "Piral instance") and patterns for creating pilets.

## Recipes for Piral Instances

- [A Static Piral Instance](./static-piral-instance.md)

## Patterns for Creating Pilets
