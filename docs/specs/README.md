# Specifications

For maximum reusability Piral tries to be fully specified. As a consequence, it is possible to *not* use Piral at all while keeping compatibility with existing pilets or Piral instances. Furthermore, replacing any component that has been created by us with a custom solution is totally fine and possible. In fact, we encourage you to create your own applications and modules without using our stack. Probing the specification is important in ensuring that its goals are fulfilled.

The available specifications:

- [Piral API specification](./piral-api-specification.md)
- [Pilet specification](./pilet-specification.md)
