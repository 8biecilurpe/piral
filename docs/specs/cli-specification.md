# Piral CLI Specification

## Abstract

The Piral CLI is a command line tool, which offers a rich feature set to allow building application shells for Microfrontend solutions. The application shell can be used as a host and an emulator for smaller applications (known as Microfrontends). As part of the Piral framework we call those small applications *pilets*. In addition, the Piral CLI is capable of generating valid NPM packages, which can be published to the Piral Feed Service.

## Introduction

For building client-side microfrontends, a combination of tools is required. The Piral framework tries to simplify this process by offering a tool (`piral-cli`) to help with the most common processes. While this tool may be handy for most developers, it may be too restrictive for others. Therefore, we wanted to provide with this specification the description for all necessary processes to support custom implementations, too.


## Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words *MAY*, *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *OPTIONAL*, *SHOULD*, and *SHOULD NOT* are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Building a Piral Instance

A Piral instance represents an app shell for hosting pilets. It will be either based on `piral`, `piral-core`, or `piral-base`.

### Building for Production Purposes

When building the Piral instance for production, the following environment variables should be provided:

| Environment Variable  | Purpose                             | Example            |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `NODE_ENV`            | Indicate the target environment.    | `production`       |
| `SHARED_DEPENDENCIES` | Allow exposing shared dependencies. | `react,react-dom`  |

In addition, some special keys of the `package.json` are relevant for a production build:

| Key                   | Purpose                             | Example            |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `app`                 | Path to the root page to use.       | `"src/index.html"` |
| `pilets`.`externals`  | Names of the shared dependencies.   | `["reactstrap"]`   |

The bundler application also needs to understand that a file ending with `.codegen` should be pre-evaluated before included as a module. In case of a Piral instance we will need to evaluate the `dependencies.codegen` file, if the environment variable `SHARED_DEPENDENCIES` is set.

### Building for Emulation Purposes

When executing the piral instance for emulation purposes, some additional capabilities have to be integrated. One example of such a capability is the debug API. This API is inserted into `window` at runtime for inspection purposes. The browser extension *Piral Inspector* may be used for debugging the API conveniently.

For running the priral instance in emulation mode, the set of relevant environment variables is slightly different: 

| Environment Variable  | Purpose                             | Example            |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `NODE_ENV`            | Indicate the target environment.    | `development`      |
| `DEBUG_PILET`         | Injects pilet from development API. | `/$pilet-api`      |
| `DEBUG_PIRAL`         | Provides debug API for inspection.  | `1.0`              |
| `SHARED_DEPENDENCIES` | Allow exposing shared dependencies. | `react,react-dom`  |

As in the case for generating a production instance, some special keys of the `package.json` are also considered for the emulation mode:

| Key                   | Purpose                             | Example            |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `app`                 | Path to the root page to use.       | `"src/index.html"` |
| `pilets`.`externals`  | Names of the shared dependencies.   | `["reactstrap"]`   |

The bundler application also needs to understand that a file ending with `.codegen` should be pre-evaluated before included as a module. In case of a Piral instance we will need to evaluate the `dependencies.codegen` file, if the environment variable `SHARED_DEPENDENCIES` is set.

## Building a Pilet

A pilet is a module, which can be hosted in a Piral instances. It can be published to a feed service. The feed service then serves the modules for execution in the Piral instance. When building a pilet, the following environment variables are evaluated:

Used environment variables:

| Environment Variable  | Purpose                             | Example            |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `NODE_ENV`            | Indicate the target environment.    | `production`       |

Some special fields of the `package.json` are used to switch on some building features.

| Key                   | Purpose                             | Example            |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| `app`                 | Path to the root page to use.       | `"src/index.html"` |
| `peerDependencies`    | Indicates skipped dependencies.     | `{ "react": "*" }` |
| `externals`           | Names of additional externals.      | `[ "reactstrap" ]` |
| `piral`.`name`        | Name of the Piral instance.         | `"sample-piral"`   |

### Schema Versions

The Piral supports specifying different mechanisms for loading pilets. To allow versioning of a pilet's loading mechanism, we use a special header line in the output bundle. If the first line starts with a comment such as `//@pilet`, it will be treated as the pilet schema version indicator.

Right now, there are two available schema versions: the legacy version is indicated by (`v0`) and the current standard version is (`v1`). Backwards compatibility should always be given, when introducing a new schema version.

Most notably the following components should all be able to gracefully fall back:

- The Piral instance (consumer)
- The Pilet Feed service (provider)
- The Pilet script itself (module)

**`v:0`**

The bundled code should be wrapped in an IIFE, which looks similar to:

```js
//@pilet v:0
!(function(global, require) {
  const __bundleUrl__ = /* determine bundle URL */;

  /* insert bundled code */

  global.$pr_name = require;
}(window, window.$pr_name));
```

The `$pr_name` has to be replaced with the globally used name for `require` of the pilet.

**`v:1`**

The bundled code should be wrapped in an IIFE to look similar to:

```js
//@pilet v:1($pr_name)
!(function(global, require) {
  const __bundleUrl__ = /* determine bundle URL */;
  function define(getExports) {
    if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
      document.currentScript.app = getExports();
    }
  }
  define.amd = true;

  /* insert bundled code */

  global.$pr_name = require;
}(window, window.$pr_name));
```

The `$pr_name` has to be replaced with the globally used name for `require` of the pilet.

## Limitations

The specification does not cover things like validation, declaration generation, scaffolding, or upgrading.

## Examples

The best example for following this specification is the `piral-cli` package itself.
