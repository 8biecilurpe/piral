# Available Commands

The Piral CLI is a command line tool that helps to simplify everyday tasks for making development of a modularized frontend simple and flexible. Instead of writing our own tool from scratch we rely on existing tools that come with their mature ecosystems.

## Piral Related Commands

These commands have all a `-piral` suffix when called from the generic `pb` tool. They are also available on the `piral` tool (here without the suffix, i.e., `pb build-piral` is equivalent to `piral build`).

- [build-piral](./build-piral.md)
- [debug-piral](./debug-piral.md)
