# Sharing Dependencies

Sharing dependencies is one of the selling points of Piral. The key, however, is not to *overshare*, i.e., to share too much. With every shared dependency a certain burden / debt is included. If too many dependencies are shared, the dependency management will become too complicated and eventually collapse.

Our recommendation is to keep the sharing of dependencies from the app shell as practical as possible.
