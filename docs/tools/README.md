# Tools

Piral is an end-to-end solution for creating large-scale web applications using micro frontends. As such we also try to create an ecosystem of tools that is helpful.

## Available Tooling

The following tooling documentation is available right now:

- [Piral Inspector](./piral-inspector.md)
- [VSCode Piral](./vscode-piral.md)
