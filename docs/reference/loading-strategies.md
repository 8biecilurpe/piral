# Loading Strategies

To orchestrate how pilets are loaded a loading strategy is implemented. In most cases the default loading strategy is the most suitable one.

::: tip: Strategies come with `piral.base`
The package to come with the available loading strategies is the most basic Piral package `piral-base`, which forms the framework independent basis for Piral.
