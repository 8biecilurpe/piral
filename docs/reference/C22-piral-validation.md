# Piral Instance Validation

The `piral-cli` contains a tool that can perform Piral-related validations.

By default, this tool can provide:

- check if development dependencies are fine
- check dependencies for occurrences of the Piral framework
- check if declared shared dependencies are fine
- check if the given scaffolding metadata is good
- check if the entry point is acceptable (HTML)
