# Pilet Validation

The `piral-cli` contains a tool that can perform Piral-related validations.

By default, this tool can provide:

- check if externals are properly marked / included
- check dependencies for occurences of the Piral framework
- check third-party dependencies
- check size of bundled pilet
- check for outdated Piral instances
