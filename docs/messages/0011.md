# Error: 0011

Reported when the Piral instance defined in the package.json seems invalid.

## Description

There are a couple of properties that need to be fulfilled by a valid Piral instance.
An important property is that the package.json contains an "app" field.

The app field denotes the entry point of the Piral instance for bundling purposes.
It should be an HTML file.

## Example

Make sure the package.json of the Piral instance is valid (has an "app" field).

This could look as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "my-piral",
  // ...
  "app": "src/index.html"
}
```
