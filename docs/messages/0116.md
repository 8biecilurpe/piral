The "feed" provider requires a "--opts.version" argument.

## Description

The `piral publish --type release` command requires the selection of a suitable
provider for running successfully. The "feed" provider releases the files to
the a Piral Feed Service with the static page feature.

Make sure to supply the version either explicitly via the `--opts.version` argument
or implicitly by having the artifacts stored in a sub-directory of the project's root,
which contains a package.json with the version to use.

## Example

The following command would specify version "1.2.3" for the feed service:

```sh
piral publish --type release --provider feed --opts.url "..." --opts.apikey "..." --opts.version "1.2.3"
```
