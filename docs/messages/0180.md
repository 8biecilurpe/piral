# Warning: 0180

No pilet.json has been found.

## Description

For some functionality such as multi Piral instance support when debugging
a pilet, a special file called pilet.json is required. While this file is
optional in general, it must be available for certain tasks such as adding
or removing a Piral instance for debugging purposes.

## Example

If no pilet.json is yet available you can create one. It should be adjacent to
the package.json of your pilet, even though different locations are also possible.
By default, the following content can be used for an empty file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.piral.io/schemas/pilet-v0.json"
}
```
