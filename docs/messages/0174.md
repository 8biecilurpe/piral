# Error: 0174

The bundling process failed.

## Description

For transforming sources (e.g., a Piral instance or a pilet) into a single
set of distributables (JS, CSS, other assets) a bundler is used. When the
transformation process fails the Piral CLI will report the received error
from the underlying bundler.

The detailed set of logs / messages should be available in the command
line. These are formatted according to the currently used bundler.

## Example

Use the following command to make the parcel bundler available:

```sh
npm i piral-cli-parcel --save-dev
```
