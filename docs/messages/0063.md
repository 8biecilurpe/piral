# Warning: 0063

Could not read the contents from the pilet.

## Description

Publishing pilet requires a valid tgz file that can be read and transmitted.
If such a file can be found, however, cannot be opened then we have no chance
of publishing the pilet.

This warning is thus emitted in case of:

- an empty tgz file
- an inaccessible tgz file

Make sure that the disk is properly functioning and that necessary permissions
are set to allow accessing the file.

## Example

Find the available tgz files:

```sh
ls -la *.tgz
```

Make sure that at least one tgz file is available. Check the displayed permissions
and use `chmod` to set the right permissions.

Usually, changing permissions should not be required at all. Make sure you operate
from the same user account as when the tgz file was created.
