# Warning: 0301

The declared Piral instances are different.

## Description

In a multi-pilet debugging scenario where one (or more) pilets
declared a different Piral instance in their package.json this
warning appears. It should remind you that only the Piral instance
from the first found pilet will be used.

Usually the warning is an indicator for you that something is not
right. It could be that an invalid pilet, or a wrong folder or
repository has been mixed in your multi-pilet debugging source set.

## Example

Have a look at the package.json of each pilet. Find the differences
and either re-align them, improve your multi-pilet selection, or
remove the invalid pilet.
