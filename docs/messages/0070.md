# Warning: 0070

The browser could not be opened.

## Description

The Piral CLI uses a package called "open" for automatically opening a browser.
The package tries to find the system's default browser and open it with the URL
given by the currently started debug process.

This will fail under the following circumstances:

- There are not enough rights to know what is the default browser
- There are not enough rights to open the default browser
- The default browser cannot be opened
- The API for opening the default browser is invalid

## Example

The browser is usually just opened via the command line:

```sh
pilet debug --open
```
