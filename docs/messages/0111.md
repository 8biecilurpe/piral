# Error: 0111

Could not find exactly one *.tgz file.

## Description

The `piral publish --type emulator` command only works if a single *.tgz
file is found in the "emulator" subdirectory of the provided output directory.

Make sure to run `piral build` before running `piral publish`.

## Example

The following command first removes the output directory, then starts the build,
and finally publishes the emulator to npm.

```sh
rm -rf dist
piral build --target dist
piral publish dist --type emulator
```
