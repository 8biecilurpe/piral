# Error: 0110

The provided output directory could not be found.

## Description

The `piral publish` command only works with a valid output directory. Make
sure to provide the same directory that you used for `piral build`.

Make sure to run `piral build` before running `piral publish`.

## Example

The following command first removes the output directory, then starts the build,
and finally publishes the emulator to npm.

```sh
rm -rf dist
piral build --target dist
piral publish dist --type emulator
```
