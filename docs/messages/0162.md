# Warning: 0162

The HTTP post request was reported to be unsuccessful. The server indicated
that the same version of this pilet was already published.

## Description

While submitting the HTTP get request an error was reported.

Potentially, the server returned some more indicative error message. In this
case read it carefully to know what version was already published.

In any case you need to change the version to continue. You can do that by
editing the "version" field in the pilet's package.json or using `npm version`.

## Example

If you already published the pilet, e.g., via

```sh
pilet publish --api-key ... --url ...
```

then doing this again without any change should result in this error.

Now we can patch-upgrade the version of the pilet:

```sh
npm version patch
```

And try the `pilet publish` command again. This time it should just work.
