# Error: 0068

The HTTP get request failed.

## Description

While submitting the HTTP get request an error was reported. This usually indicates
a problem with the network, either due to

- loss of connectivity
- an invalid host name (DNS broken)
- a system restriction (e.g., firewall)
- invalid SSL certificate

It could also mean that the endpoint is not reachable or requires additional headers /
authentication for retrieving the content.

## Example

The easiest way to replicate an error would be to use an invalid host.

```sh
pilet publish https://doesnotexist/api/pilet.tgz --from remote
```
