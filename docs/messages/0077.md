## Description

Pilets will be bundled by specifying their root module. The
root module is the module containing the exported `setup`
function, which is then used by the app shell to integrate
the pilet.

## Example

Let's say you started by scaffolding a pilet like so:

```sh
npm init pilet
```

This will give you a `src` folder containing the root module named
`index.tsx`.

In this case you'd write:

```sh
pilet debug src/index.tsx
```

While in some scenarios we support dropping the extension there are
some edge cases that would not work without an extension. Our
recommendation is to be explicit about the root module's extension.
