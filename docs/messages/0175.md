# Warning: 0175

No bundler has been specified even though multiple are available.

## Description

Piral allows you to set up your own tooling for building and debugging. This
is a powerful concept. By default, the Webpack v5 bundler is used.
Alternatives include Parcel and Rollup.

In case where multiple bundlers are installed the first one is picked. This
may not be what you want. In this scenario you can explicitly set the bundler
to use by providing a bundler name (e.g., "parcel").

The warning is shown when there are multiple bundlers available, but none has
been explicitly demanded. Since the chosen bundler may be installation
dependent we recommend setting the bundler explicitly.

## Example

Use the following command to explicitly choose the Parcel bundler:

```sh
piral build --bundler parcel
```
