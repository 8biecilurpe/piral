# Error: 0041

The section "piral" in the "package.json" file is missing.

## Description

The Piral CLI has to get some meta information for a pilet from its package.json.
The meta information include its name, version, which Piral instance to use, as well
as other relevant infos.

Make sure that you modified the package.json correctly using the specification for
pilets or that the pilet was initially created / scaffolded by the Piral CLI using
the

```sh
pilet new
```

command.

Specifically, the package.json needs to contain a special key called `piral`, which
contains an object with additional fields.

## Example

Your pilet's package.json may look similar to the following snippet:

```json
{
  "name": "my-pilet",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "my-piral": "1.0.0",
    "piral-cli": "0.11.0"
  },
  "piral": {
    "name": "my-piral",
    "tooling": "0.11.0"
  }
}
```
