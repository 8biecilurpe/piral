# Error: 0113

The given release provider could not be found.

## Description

The `piral publish --type release` command requires the selection of a suitable
provider for running successfully. The available providers can be extended via
plugins for the `piral-cli` command-line tooling.

If a given provider cannot be found we get the error message incl. the list of
available providers. If that happens to be inaccurate check if your Node modules
have been installed correctly. If in doubt, remove the `node_modules` folder and
reinstall your dependencies.

## Example

The following command uses the in-built "xcopy" provider for releasing to a local directory.

```sh
piral publish --type release --provider xcopy --opts.target "/temp/dest"
```
