# Warning: 0161

The HTTP post request was reported to be unsuccessful. The server indicated
that some payment is required before this pilet can be published.

## Description

While submitting the HTTP get request an error was reported.

Potentially, the server returned some more indicative error message. In this
case read it carefully to know what version was already published.

In any case only the documentation of the corresponding feed service can be
conclusive how this can be resolved. Presumably, some payment of some fee
is necessary to publish pilets.
