# Warning: 0303

The declared shared dependencies are different.

## Description

In a multi-pilet debugging scenario where one (or more) pilets
declared a different set of externals in their package.json this
warning appears. It should remind you that only the externals from
the first found pilet will be used.

Usually the warning is an indicator for you that something is not
right. It could be that some pilet(s) have not been properly set up
or updated.

## Example

Have a look at the package.json of each pilet. Find the differences
and either re-align them, improve your multi-pilet selection, or
remove the invalid pilet.
