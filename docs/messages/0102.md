# Info: 0102

The Piral CLI could not detect the tooling version used by the app shell. Therefore, it may be incompatible to the
currently used version of the piral-cli. Keep an eye on weird errors.

## Description

The emulator contains a special section to inform the Piral CLI about the used version of the tooling. This is
important to detect potential alignment or incompatibilities. The used version of the emulator does not contain
this information and therefore may be incompatible.
