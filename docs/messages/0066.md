# Warning: 0066

The HTTP post request was reported to be unsuccessful.

## Description

The URL could be reached, however, the returned status code did not indicate success.
Note that only a status code of 200 will be interpreted as successful.

The error message prints the received status text and status code. Usually, this should be
sufficient to know where the problem lies. Some feed service implementations will also provide
a custom payload with further information. This response body will also be printed.

## Example

The easiest way to replicate an error would be to use any URL.

```sh
pilet publish --url https://example.com/api/pilet
```
