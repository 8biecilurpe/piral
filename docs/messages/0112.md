# Error: 0112

The "xcopy" provider requires a "--opts.target" argument.

## Description

The `piral publish --type release` command requires the selection of a suitable
provider for running successfully. The "xcopy" provider just copies the sources from
the output directory (source) to a specified target directory.

Make sure to supply the target directory via the `--opts.target` command line flag.

## Example

The following command would specify `/temp/dest` as target directory:

```sh
piral publish --type release --provider xcopy --opts.target "/temp/dest"
```
