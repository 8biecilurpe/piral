# Error: 0173

No default bundler is available.

## Description

Piral allows you to set up your own tooling for building and debugging. This
is a powerful concept. By default, the Webpack bundler is used. Alternatives
include Parcel and Rollup.

In case where no bundler is installed and the default bundler could not be
successfully installed this error is shown.

## Example

Use the following command to make the parcel bundler available:

```sh
npm i piral-cli-parcel --save-dev
```
