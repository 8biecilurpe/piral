# Error: 0046

Reported when a file could not be found.

## Description

Usually, this only indicates that a file already existed and was deleted or
that the configuration is corrupt.

Make sure to have a valid Piral instance and the latest version of the Piral
CLI installed. Verify that the node_modules have not been corrupted.

To avoid any issues try to upgrade the Piral CLI and reinstall the project
dependencies.

## Example

On some systems the node_modules folder may become instable or get corrupted
with multiple dependency installations and modifications. After a time a
complete swipe may be the best solution to ensure a stable project
configuration.
