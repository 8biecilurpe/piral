# Error: 0072

The provided bundler is not available.

## Description

Piral allows you to set up your own tooling for building and debugging. This
is a powerful concept. By default, the Parcel bundler is used. Alternatives
include Webpack and Rollup.

In case where multiple bundlers are installed the first one is picked. This
may not be what you want. In this scenario you can override the selection by
explicitly picking a bundler name (e.g., "parcel"). If, for some reason, the
name does not correspond to one of the currently installed bundlers the
bundler missing error appears.

## Example

Use the following command to make the parcel bundler available:

```sh
npm i piral-cli-parcel --save-dev
```
