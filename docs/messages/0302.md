# Warning: 0302

The used Piral instance versions are different.

## Description

In a multi-pilet debugging scenario where one (or more) pilets
declared the same Piral instance in their package.json, but the
found Piral instances have different versions, this warning appears.
It should remind you that only the Piral instance from the first
found pilet will be used.

Usually the warning is an indicator for you that something is not
right. It could be that some pilet(s) have not been properly set up
or updated.

## Example

Have a look at the package.json of each pilet. Find the differences
and either re-align them, improve your multi-pilet selection, or
remove the invalid pilet.
