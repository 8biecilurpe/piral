# Warning: 0176

No bundler has been installed yet.

## Description

Piral allows you to set up your own tooling for building and debugging. This
is a powerful concept. By default, the Webpack v5 bundler is used.
Alternatives include Parcel and Rollup.

In case no bundler is yet installed the Piral CLI will automatically install
the default bundler. However, you should consider installing a bundler of your
choice (even if this could also be the default bundler) explicitly.

## Example

Use the following command to install esbuild as a bundler with the npm client:

```sh
npm i piral-cli-esbuild --save-dev
```
