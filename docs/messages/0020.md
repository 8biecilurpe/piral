# Error: 0020

No valid package.json found

## Description

For performing this action on the pilet more information is required, which should come from
the project's package.json.

To operate correctly the piral-cli needs to read information provided in the package.json.
Unfortunately, in the given scenario no package.json was found, or the contents of the found
package.json have not met the expected standard.

Make sure to operate the piral-cli only in a valid Node.js project folder. A valid Node.js
project folder has a package.json in its root.

## Example

You can see if you are currently in a correct folder.

```sh
ls package.json
```

If nothing is displayed make sure to either change to the right directory, or to start a new
project using:

```sh
npm init
```

If you want to start directly with a pilet just use the following command:

```sh
npm init pilet
```
