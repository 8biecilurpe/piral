The HTTP post response body data.

## Description

When the pilet was successfully updated the server is free to respond with
whatever HTTP body. Since the content of this body may be interesting, we
show the content in the terminal.

Note that we serialize the content to a string. So the result may not look
as wanted from the server's perspective. In general we do not recommend to
transport lengthy messages as a result of publishing a pilet.

## Example

The easiest way to see the output is to publish a pilet to the temporary feed.

```sh
pilet publish --api-key ac6c202085f07099da1729a20e5750e651ef093ef4a5856c70997a6cc71dcab2 --url https://feed.piral.cloud/api/v1/pilet/temp
```
