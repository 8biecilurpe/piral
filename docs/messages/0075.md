# Error: 0075

The project is missing a package.json.

## Description

Make sure to start the Piral CLI in the right directory. It should run from the project's
root directory. A Node.js project's root directory contains a file called package.json.

The package.json contains important meta information such as the name, version, and entry
point for the bundler.

## Example

You can create a new npm project using the `npm init` command. This will essentially guide
you through a number of decisions for creating a proper package.json.

Even better you could start a new pilet using the following command:

```sh
npm init pilet
```

This will create or patch a package.json to be a valid pilet.
