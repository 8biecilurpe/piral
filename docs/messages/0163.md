# Warning: 0163

The HTTP post request was reported to be unsuccessful. The server indicated
that the size of the pilet was too large.

## Description

While submitting the HTTP get request an error was reported.

Potentially, the server returned some more indicative error message. In this
case read it carefully to know how much the limit was exceeded.

In any case the pilet must be somehow trimmed down. Most often, the size is
dominantly determined by some external packages that are referened. Use a
page such as bundlephobia.com or some IDE tools to find out which packages
are to blame. Also tools such as the Webpack or Parcel bundle analyzer can
be helpful to determine the source of the bundle size.
