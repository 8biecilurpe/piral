Piral CLI is a command-line tool that can also be used as a library. It should make common tasks such as building a pilet, scaffolding a pilet, or debugging a piral instance simple.

Internally, Piral CLI is build upon existing tools with connection points to their respective eco-systems. For instance, the build / debug commands use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) and can be configured / extended just like a normal Parcel build job could be. This way the whole Parcel ecosystem including possibilities for you to roll out your own plugins is possible.
