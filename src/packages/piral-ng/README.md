This is an extension library that only has a peer dependency to `piral-core`. What `piral-ext` brings to the table is a set of API extensions that can be used with `piral` or `piral-core`. By default, these extensions are not integrated in `piral`, so you'd need to add them to your Piral instance. The set includes an `register...Ng` method for each `register...X` method of the standard API surface.
