# Piral Samples

Piral is developed as a monorepo.

## Available Samples

- [sample-piral](./sample-piral/README.md) is an example based on the full Piral framework
- [sample-piral-core](./sample-piral-core/README.md) is an example based on the `piral-core` library

## Development of Piral Samples

Some elementary samples that may be also used for component tests or useful showcases are developed inside this monorepo. Right now we have two samples inside the monorepo. Our recommendation is to use samples that are *not* in the monorepo to display the abilities of Piral to persons unfamiliar with it. The complexity or structure may be daunting.

## Vision for the Samples

While the `piral-core` demo will remain very basic from the design, the `piral` demo (also called "demo-full") should eventually be a nice looking SPA that shares some similarities with common smart phone operating systems. The sample pilets used inside will be presented like apps, as they will have not much in common, but can communicate with each other and hook into their "operating system" (the app shell).
