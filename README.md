Easily build a next generation portal application. Piral enables you to create a modular frontend application that is extended at runtime with decoupled modules called *pilets* leveraging a microfrontend architecture. A pilet can be developed independently and ships with the necessary JavaScript and bundled assets.

:zap: A pilet is capable of dynamically extending other pilets or using such extension slots itself. Otherwise, a pilet is quite isolated (developed and handled) and will never destroy your application.
